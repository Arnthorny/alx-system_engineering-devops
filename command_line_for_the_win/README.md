# Project: Command line for the win


### Steps to Upload screenshot files using SFTP protocol
- I opened the terminal on my  local machine.
- I used the SFTP command-line tool to establish a connection to the sandbox environment. 
- The hostname, username, and password was provided from the sandbox menu on the intranet.
- Once I established connection, I used the **lcd** and **cd** command to navigate to the directory for upload.
- After navigating, I used the SFTP put command to upload the screenshots from my local machine to the sandbox.
- With the **ls** command, I Confirmed that the screenshots had been successfully transferred.
- I then proceeded to push the screenshots to this GitHub repository.
